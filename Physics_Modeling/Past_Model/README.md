Past Simulation Model

First - >>> python arm_sim.py
 -- Creates an animation based on initial angles, arm segment lengths,
max angular velocity, acceleration constant, and goal point(end effector destination).

 -- Create a pickle file with torque values saved.

Second - >>> python simulation_torque.py

 -- Displays recorded torque values based on conditions set in arm_sim.py
